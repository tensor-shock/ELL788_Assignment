## Computer Perception Sensation and Cognition

Code to make gratings and to determine at what Cycle/degree value does the grating seem to vanish and becomes imperceptible to the human eye.

Libraries used:  matplotlib and time

OBSERVER'S EYE IS TO BE KEPT AT 114 CMS FROM THE SCREEN

Calculations for cycle width:

one cycle in ~2 cm screen space kept at 114 cm has 1 cpd as tan(1 degree) ~ 2/114\
therefore 1 unit of thickness in python for window size (12,7) = 0.02 cm\
one cycle in 100 units screen space kept at 114 cm has 1 cpd\
one cycle in 100/x units screen space kept at 114 cm has x cpd
